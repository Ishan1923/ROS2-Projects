ROS2-Projects
ROS2 implementation using Raspberry Pi 3B+

Overview
This repository contains various ROS2 projects developed for the Raspberry Pi 3B+. The goal is to demonstrate and experiment with ROS2 nodes, sensor integration, and robotics concepts using Python.

Contents
Currently, the repository includes:

1. HCSR04 Publisher Node
Location: src/HCSR04_pub/HCSR04_pub/
Description:
ROS2 node in Python that interfaces with the HC-SR04 ultrasonic distance sensor. This node reads distance measurements and publishes them to a ROS2 topic, enabling integration with other ROS2 nodes and robotics applications.
Main Script:
__init__.py
Getting Started
Prerequisites
Raspberry Pi 3B+ (or compatible)
ROS2 installed (tested with [your ROS2 distro, e.g., Foxy, Galactic])
Python 3.x
HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Sensor (for HCSR04_pub package)
Installation
Clone the repository:

bash
git clone https://github.com/Ishan1923/ROS2-Projects.git
cd ROS2-Projects
Install dependencies:
(Add any required pip packages here if applicable.)

Build the workspace:

bash
# If using colcon and standard ROS2 workspace layout
colcon build
source install/setup.bash
Connect the HC-SR04 sensor to the appropriate GPIO pins on your Raspberry Pi.

Running the HCSR04 Publisher Node
bash
ros2 run HCSR04_pub hcsr04_pub
(Update the command above with the actual entry point/script name if different.)
